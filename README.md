## CWE-Table
In an effor to learn safety in lower level languages, I set forth to find the common vulnerabilities in software and came across CWE.

Both tables from 2023 were taken from the [top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html#top25list) and [on the cusp](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_onthecusp_list.html#tableView) tables.

This repo is just a result of the annoyance of needing 2 bookmarks for the segmented data (*although the top 25 are the *most* important without question*). It's also a quick share amongst other coders.
